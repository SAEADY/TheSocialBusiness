        This websites aims to illuminate the issues of the social media business practice. While social media can be a source of connection and creativity, its unprecedented and quick rise to popularity means we haven't been able to adapt to it yet. From fake news to mental health struggles and the echo chambers created by algorithms, social media has its dark side. However, it's not all doom and gloom. With better regulations and increased awareness, we can learn to use social media in productive and amazing ways. I hope this website encourages dialogue about the need for responsible use and oversight in our rapidly digital age. It's about realizing how these business practices affect our interaction and relationship with social media so that we can use it more responsibly.
