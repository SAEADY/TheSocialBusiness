    <p> 
        Surveillance capitalism treats human experiences as a resource, converting them into behavioral data. Some of the data gets used to make products better, but the extra is seen as a valuable bonus. It's fed into advanced processes, creating prediction models that anticipate our actions. These predictions are sold in markets, making those who gather them very rich. To gather more predictive data, they acquire our voices, personalities, and emotions. They've learned that intervening in our activities yields the most predictive data. This shift from merely knowing our behavior to actively shaping it is driven by competition. Now, the aim isn't just to understand us, it's to control us.

       <p> An echo chamber is an environment where individuals are exposed only to information and opinions that align with their existing beliefs, reinforcing their perspectives. This can lead to misinformation and hinder their ability to consider opposing viewpoints. Fueled by confirmation bias, individuals tend to favor information that confirms their beliefs. The internet introduces a unique echo chamber known as a filter bubble, created by algorithms tracking user interactions. These bubbles restrict exposure to diverse content, limiting the discovery of new ideas and perspectives. </p>

            <p> Social media plays a big role in politics. It can influence how people think and vote. For example, there was a situation with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. They used people's Facebook data to target them with specific ads that could change their opinions. This shows how social media can have a big impact on what people believe and how they act politically. Posts on platforms like Facebook and Twitter can make people feel strongly about different topics, which can cause disagreements. So, it's important to make sure that social media is fair and that people can tell what's true and what's not when it comes to politics. </p>
