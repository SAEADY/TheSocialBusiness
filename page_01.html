    <p> 
        Surveillance capitalism treats human experiences as a resource, converting them into behavioral data. Some of the data gets used to make products better, but the extra is seen as a valuable bonus. This extra data on our actions, emotions and behaviours is used to sell us stuff and keep people using their websites or apps.

        <p> Social Media makes money by having active users stay engaged on their site or app as long and as much as possible, making it their primary motive. Every like, click and scroll gives the companies more info on you and how they can modify what you see to keep you on the app.</p>
         <h2>Time on apps = more data = curated experience = even more time = more money.</h2>

      <p class="text">An echo chamber is an environment where individuals are only exposed to information and opinions that align with their existing beliefs. This can lead to misinformation and hinder their ability to consider opposing viewpoints. This leads to a polarization of opinions, notably seen in politics.</p>
