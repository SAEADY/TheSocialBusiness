         Social Media has been important for spreading important messages, like during the #BlackLivesMatter movement or the #MeToo movement. However, many argue that social media does not have enough regulations in place to prevent false news from spreading especially as it becomes more and more people's primary source for news. <br> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #52d99a;">Over 80% of Americans </span> now get news from digital devices, surpassing TV, radio, and print. Among young adults, social media is the top news source.  Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok act as news hubs, blurring opinions and facts.

NewsGuard, a journalism and technology tool that tracks online information, analyzed <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #52d99a;"> 540 TikTok results </span>, examining the top 20 from 27 searches on news topics. They found that <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #52d99a;"> nearly 2/10 videos </span> contained false or misleading claims. </p>

            <p> This has led to many real world consequences. Such as rapid and changing misinformation spread during Covid-19 where being confined at home led more and more people to accept social media news as their primary source. Often this misinformation is used to promote certain beliefs or political motives, such as in the case of what is now refered to as "#PizzaGate" a conspiracy theory and spread of false information intended to discredit Hillary Clinton. A social media  rumour spread that Hillary Clinton and her staff were involved in various illegal activities which through more false articles then spiralled into the misinformation that she was running a child trafficking ring out of a pizza place in Washington. This misinformation led a North-Carolina man to visit the pizza place with a gun and to fire his weapon (not hitting anyone) in a very misguided attempt to rescue children. </p>
