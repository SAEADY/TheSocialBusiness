Social media has also redefined the way we can and do make connections and keep in touch with each other. Social media can be used in finding new connections with people with similar interests and keeping in touch with friends and family. It's online communities can provide a space for sharing that people might not have access to in their lives. During COVID-19, social interaction and humor on social media eased stress. However, it also poses many risks. Studies find correlation between mental health and social media and while correlation is not always causation, multiple research studies suggest it may lead to body image issues, addiction, cyberbullying, and worsening moods. Excessive use can worsen these feelings of loneliness, fear of missing out, and lower life satisfaction.

       <p> Between 2012 and 2015, depression rose by 21% in boys and a big 50% in girls. In 2015, unlike before most young people had smartphones, similarly levels of depression increased. A study in 2017 found that depression increased by 33% among 8th to 12th graders from 2010 to 2015, especially affecting girls, with a 65% rise in suicide rates. Child suicide rates went up by up to 150%, and self-harm among girls aged 10 to 14 nearly tripled. These trends seem linked to social media. From 2005 to 2017, depression in teens went up by 52%, and in young adults aged 18 to 25, by 63%. Young adults also felt more stressed from 2008 to 2017, with a 47% increase in suicidal thoughts. While older adults weren't affected much, kids and young adults, who use social media a lot, felt it the most. Despite its benefits, more than 1/3 adults (38%) see social media as harmful. </p>

            <p> Social media can be tough on mental health for a few key reasons. Firstly, it's easy to compare oneself to others on platforms like Instagram, where people often share only their best moments, leading to feelings of inadequacy. Secondly, cyberbullying and online harassment are rampant, causing stress and anxiety. Thirdly, social media can become addictive, consuming a lot of time and disrupting sleep schedules. Lastly, the lack of regulation means harmful content can spread unchecked. These factors create a challenging environment especially for younger users. </p>
